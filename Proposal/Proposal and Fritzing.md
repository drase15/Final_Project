# Final_Project

For the remainder of the semester, I am wanting to create a moving robot with a pen holder, so that it can draw as it rolls around if the pen is activated using a servo. I think it would be interesting if the robot could be controlled in several different ways, whether that be by an accelerometer attached to a transmitter and a receiver, using the capsensors I created for my musical instrument, or by using an IR sensor. While it is rather easy to find robots that do one of these things at a time, I think making one that has variable options is interesting. The robot will have buttons that act as switches, and can change which of the sensors is in control of the robot. I will be able to 3D print the chassis and cover using my printer.
