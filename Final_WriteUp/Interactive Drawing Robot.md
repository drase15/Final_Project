My goal for the project was to create a machine that drew the same toolpaths for every run, but every individual drawing would be different dependent upon how people played with the light sensor. 

By using two steppers, one that rotates the arm, one that controls the extension of the arm, I was able to physically move the servo. The pen was attached to the servo, which was mapped to the range of the light sensor. The steppers were driven by an external power source and two big easy drivers. All was run through an ArduinoUno.
